I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Computational and Biological Learning Lab (CBL) at the Department of Engineering of the University of Cambridge, where I am collaborating with Máté Lengyel and Yashar Ahmadian.

My research focuses on how neural circuits give rise to complex cognitive functions. For this I use theoretical and computational methods to investigate the computational principles of biological neural networks.
During my Ph.D., I showed how networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with rich computational functions can emerge from realistic plasticity mechanisms while the statistical structure of their inputs became reflected in their recurrent connectivity.
Currently, I work on generalising these models to episodic memory circuits in the hippocampus. My hope is that in the future, a better understanding of these circuits will help to understand why we remember some experiences but not others and how memory acquisition can be facilitated or disturbed.

See my [CV](/cv) and [past research projects](/projects) for additional details.
