I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Computational and Biological Learning Lab (CBL) at the  University of Cambridge, where I am collaborating with Máté Lengyel and Yashar Ahmadian. I obtained a Ph.D. at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research (MPIBR) and the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS), working with Julijana Gjorgjieva and Jochen Triesch, respectively.

My research focuses on how neural brain circuits give rise to complex cognitive functions. For this I use theoretical and computational methods to investigate models of biological neural networks that contain inhibitory neurons.
During my Ph.D., I demonstrated how networks with rich computational functions can emerge from realistic plasticity mechanisms.
Currently, I am working on generalising these models to memory circuits in the hippocampus.

See my [CV](/cv) and [past research projects](/projects) for additional details.
